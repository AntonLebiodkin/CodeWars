# Katas
In our dojo, kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. 
Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. 
Each kata is crafted for and by the community. 

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. 
The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow 
to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published 21 different katas.
